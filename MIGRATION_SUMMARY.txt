FOR NON-PROGRAMMERS
================================================================================

Start Here: docs/MIGRATION_QUICK_START.md (5 minutes)

This guide includes:
- Simple decision tree to help you decide
- Easy-to-understand cost comparison
- No-jargon explanations
- Clear next steps

Key Question: "Should I migrate?"
Answer: Probably not! Current setup is great for most use cases.

Only migrate if you have very specific needs (compliance, huge scale, etc.)

================================================================================
FOR DEVELOPERS
================================================================================

Start Here: docs/ARCHITECTURE_COMPARISON.md (20 minutes)

Then: docs/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md (1 hour)

The migration guide includes:
- Complete AWS migration path
- Complete Google Cloud migration path
- Database migration with pgvector setup
- Backend functions conversion (Deno → Node.js/Lambda/Cloud Functions)
- Frontend deployment (Amplify, S3+CloudFront, Firebase)

================================================================================
MIGRATION TIMELINE
================================================================================

Conservative (Recommended):
- Week 1-2: Preparation & learning
- Week 3-4: Database migration
- Week 5-6: Backend functions
- Week 7: Storage & files
- Week 8: Frontend & cutover
Total: 2 months with safety buffer

Aggressive (Risky):
- Day 1-2: Setup & database
- Day 3-4: Functions & storage
- Day 5-6: Frontend & testing
- Day 7: Production cutover
Total: 1 week (only with cloud experience)

================================================================================
COST COMPARISON
================================================================================

Small Scale (< 1,000 users/month):
